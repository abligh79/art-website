  <p>Hello! If you are on this page it is most likely that you are (a) looking a piece of my work right now; (b) spoke to me in person recently; or (c) were sent to this page by someone else. In all cases, welcome. You'll find some background and perhaps some answers to questions you may have.</p>

<h2>Origin</h2>

  <p>I came to the deliberate creation of art as a hobby shortly before the pandemic. I had dabbled a bit, taking a drawing class for beginners in the 2010s, but had otherwise no experience since high school art class. My secondary education focused on the technical --- mechanical engineering for undergrad, followed by manufacturing engineering in graduate school, with equally technical jobs in parallel. In late 2019, after my career coach told me my score in visual thinking was "the highest I've ever seen,"" I came back to drawing. Maybe it was worth some focused effort to leverage this skill in a new way.</p>

  <p>I did as I often do, and my first online class was far above my level. While I struggled, I realized I needed more focused help and far more practice. I reached out to an <a href="https://www.sarinamitchel.com/">artist friend</a> and began an ongoing tutoring relationship. She helped me understand where my skills needed to improve and provided guidance as I created my first works and dabbled in different mediums. From those early days, my skills in graphite, watercolor and pen have continually and greatly improved and I continue to explore other methods for rendering what I see both in front of me and in my head.</p>
<h2>Mediums</h2>

<p><strong>Graphite:</strong> My initial target medium was the pencil, due to its accessability and my previous knowledge. My first course was from <a href="https://sibleyfineart.com">an artist</a> who does amazing things with graphite. I learned a variety of techniques for working with graphite, and it has stood as the base of my art learning.</p>

<p><strong>Pen & Watercolor:</strong> I quickly became enamored with travel and urban sketching, loving the sense of place that can be transmitted through quick sketches and the details of a place that emerge through extensive looking. While graphite is a fine tool for this type of work, work by both <a href="https://www.katiawish.com/urban-sketchbook">local artists</a> and those more widely known find pen and watercolor to be wonderful mediums for .</p>

<h3>Wait -- you say you're an artist? Where are the pictures of your art? What is your Insta handle?</h3>
You won't find either of those here. This is a deliberate choice which is reflective of my philosophy toward the creation and distribution of my art.
