  <p>Hello! If you are on this page it is most likely that you are (a) looking a piece of my work right now; (b) spoke to me in person recently; or (c) were sent to this page by someone else. In all cases, welcome. You'll find some background and perhaps some answers to questions you may have.</p>

<h2>Origin</h2>

  <p>I came to the deliberate creation of art as a hobby shortly before the pandemic. I had dabbled a bit, taking a drawing class for beginners in the 2010s, but had otherwise no experience since high school art class. My secondary education focused on the technical --- first mechanical for undergrad, followed by manufacturing engineering in graduate school, with equally technical jobs in parallel. In late 2019, after scoring, according to my career coach, "the highest I've ever seen" in visual thinking, I came back to drawing --- maybe it was worth some focused effort.</p>

  <p>I did as I often do, taking a class that was far above my level, and realizing that I needed some more focused help and far more practice. I reached out to an <a href="https://www.sarinamitchel.com/">artist friend</a> and began an ongoing tutoring relationship. She helped me understand where my skills needed to improve and provided guidance as I created my first works and dabbled in different mediums. From those early days, my skills in graphite, watercolor and pen have greatly improved and I continue to explore other methods for rendering what I see both in front of me and in my head.</p>

<h3>Wait -- you say you're an artist? Where are the pictures of your art? What is your Insta handle?</h3>
You won't find either of those here. This is a deliberate choice which is reflective of my philosophy toward the creation and distribution of my art.
